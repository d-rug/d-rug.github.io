We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behavior in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

All listserv or workgroup interactions should be professional regardless of location, thus harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

## **Enforcement**

Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately, and enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectfully implemented.

The following steps may be taken depending on the behavior and occurrence:

- Verbal warning and discussion regarding behavior or action
- Temporary ban from posting on the email listserv
- Temporary ban from attending weekly D-RUG workgroup meetings
- Permanent ban from all D-RUG activities

## **Reporting**

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, the following options exist for communicating this:

- Contact any of the Current D-RUG Coordinators (listed [here](https://d-rug.github.io/))
- You may also contact the following resources, but be aware they are **_Mandatory Reporters_**:
  - Pamela, the [Data Lab Coordinator](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/staff/)
  - The [UC Davis ombuds office](http://ombuds.ucdavis.edu/)

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
