***"The sweetest R-help group this side of the Mississippi."***

Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (D-RUG)!  We are a community of R-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other. 

Following current social distancing guidelines, we have weekly, 2-hour work sessions every Wednesday from 10am-12pm. Please see our online forum/discourse site (<a href="https://d-rug.discourse.group/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>), it's a friendly place to post R-related questions, or search for ones that have already been asked.

We have no TAs - just mutual support from folks working on/in R and related topics. A group of D-RUG coordinators help organize and schedule work sessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of R topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you're interested!

## Join the (e)Mailing List

**Join the group listserv [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug)**. The mailing list is an online supplement to our in-person work sessions. It's our way to post jobs, workshops, etc. If you want to send a message out, let us know!
