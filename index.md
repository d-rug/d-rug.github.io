***"The sweetest R-help group this side of the Mississippi."***

Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (DRUG)!  We are a community of R users at UC Davis who support each other in using R for science. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

-   ***Come to our weekly work sessions***: This is the core purpose of DRUG.  We have weekly, 2-hour work sessions where people bring their computers to work on their own projects, and ask each other questions as needed.  We have no TAs - just mutual support in R, statistics, and related topics.  Group members sometimes give short presentations on R methods and best practices or to get feedback on their projects.

    ***For Fall Quarter 2015, weekly work sessions will be be held Wednesdays 10AM-12PM in Wickson Hall Room 2120***

 - ***Join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug)***: The mailing list is an online supplement to our in-person work sessions.

 - ***Use the resources below***: We've compiled a list of resources to help you get started using R and find answers to your questions.

We're fortunate have sponsorship from [Revolution Analytics](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/) for our snacks and speaker prizes.
